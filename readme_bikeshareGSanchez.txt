My resources for the code are:

1. Udacity Classroom lessons and practice questions
2. A friend of mine named Kevin Kirchoff, helped answer general Python and Scripting questions.
3. Stack Overflow examples and function,method definitions. www.StackOverflow.com

Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!
Change the structure of bikeshare.py to make the code more efficient or in better style.
Ask and answer additional questions about the data beyond the questions already provided.
Make the interactive experience wow-worthy! Add images, make it into a web app, etc. (If you do create a web app, make sure to include clear directions how to execute it.) Make it your own!
